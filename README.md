Warning - there's no Istion in this repo (at least yet); sorry to disappoint. I'm using this as a small sample project to demonstrate Istio's features. I'm developing the course for VirtualPairProgrammers.com, Udemy and maybe others, planned for release sometime in mid 2019. 

A sample project to demonstrate Istio's features. Based on the k8s-fleetman project, with the now unnecessary features such as Ribbon and Hystrix removed.

The aim is to allow the system to run smoothly even on minikube, and to allow enough space to run a service mesh alongside.
