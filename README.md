Warning - there's no Istio in this repo (at least yet); sorry to disappoint. I'm using this as a small sample project to demonstrate Istio's features. I'm developing the course for VirtualPairProgrammers.com, Udemy and maybe others, planned for release sometime in mid 2019 (edit: it's slipping. I'll say here but not on the final course, I hate Istio...)

The aim is to allow the system to run smoothly even on minikube (4Gb required), and to allow enough space to run a service mesh alongside.
